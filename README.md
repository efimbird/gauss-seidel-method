# Test task â€• Solving a system of linear equations using the Gauss-Seidel method
It is a simple console app to find roots of a system of linear equations using the Gauss-Seidel method.

To write some methods, such as *allowing zero coefficients in the main diagonal*, so as not to overload the code, a heuristic approach is used. This gives a highly accurate result, but due to its simplicity, is still not 100% accurate. That's how it's meant to be ðŸ˜Œ

### Dependencies

Please note that the scripts have dependencies on the popular *numpy* module, which may require additional installation:

```sh
$ pip install numpy
```
